This is Priscila's Matplotlib Challenge notes.

When generating a box plot that show the distribution of the tutor volume for each treatment group, I have used this part of the code:

flierprops={'marker': 'o', 'markersize': 10, 'markerfacecolor': 'fuchsia'}

From stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65648502/how-to-change-outlier-point-symbol-in-python-matplotlib-pyplot

I have also commented it in the cell right below the copied code.
